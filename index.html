    <h1>Deep dive: How do React hooks really work?</h1>

    <p>
      Hooks are a fundamentally simpler way to encapsulate stateful behavior and
      side effects in user interfaces. They were first introduced in React and
      have been broadly embraced by other frameworks like Vue, Svelte, and even
      adapted for general functional JS. However, their functional design
      requires a good understanding of closures in JavaScript. In this article,
      we reintroduce closures by building a tiny clone of React Hooks. This will
      serve two purposes â€“ to demonstrate the effective use of closures, and to
      show how you can build a Hooks clone in just 29 lines of readable JS.
      Finally, we arrive at how Custom Hooks naturally arise.
